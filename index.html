            <strong>Astrology</strong> is a range of divinatory practices,
            recognized as pseudoscientific since the 18th century, that propose
            that information about human affairs and terrestrial events may be
            discerned by studying the apparent positions of celestial objects.
            Different cultures have employed forms of astrology since at least
            the 2nd millennium BCE, these practices having originated in
            calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret
            celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Most, if not
            all, cultures have attached importance to what they observed in the
            sky, and some—such as the Hindus, Chinese, and the Maya—developed
            elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial
            observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological
            systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th-17th century BCE
            Mesopotamia, from where it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the
            Islamic world, and eventually Central and Western Europe.
            Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of
            horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality
            and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions
            of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely
            on such systems.

            Astrology, in its broadest sense, is the search for meaning in the
            sky.[25] Early evidence for humans making conscious attempts to
            measure, record, and predict seasonal changes by reference to
            astronomical cycles, appears as markings on bones and cave walls,
            which show that lunar cycles were being noted as early as 25,000
            years ago.[26] This was a first step towards recording the Moon's
            influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organising a communal
            calendar.[26] Farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing
            knowledge of the constellations that appear in the different
            seasons—and used the rising of particular star-groups to herald
            annual floods or seasonal activities.[27] By the 3rd millennium BCE,
            civilisations had sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and
            may have oriented temples in alignment with heliacal risings of the
            stars.[28]

            The Hellenistic schools of philosophical skepticism criticized the
            rationality of astrology.[clarification needed] Criticism of
            astrology by academic skeptics such as Cicero, Carneades, and
            Favorinus; and Pyrrhonists such as Sextus Empiricus has been
            preserved.Carneades argued that belief in fate denies free will and
            morality; that people born at different times can all die in the
            same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences
            from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.[12] Cicero,
            in De Divinatione, leveled a critique of astrology that some modern
            philosophers consider to be the first working definition of
            pseudoscience and the answer to the demarcation problem.[11]
            Philosopher of Science Massimo Pigliucci, building on the work of
            Historian of Science, Damien Fernandez-Beanato, argues that Cicero
            outlined a "convincing distinction between astrology and astronomy
            that remains valid in the twenty-first century."[10] Cicero stated
            the twins objection (that with close birth times, personal outcomes
            can be very different), later developed by Augustine.[34] He argued
            that since the other planets are much more distant from the Earth
            than the Moon, they could have only very tiny influence compared to
            the Moon's.[35] He also argued that if astrology explains everything
            about a person's fate, then it wrongly ignores the visible effect of
            inherited ability and parenting, changes in health worked by
            medicine, or the effects of the weather on people.[36] way as they
            affect the tides,[37] and equally absurd that small motions in the
            heavens cause large changes in people's fates. Sextus Empiricus
            argued that it was absurd to link human attributes with myths about
            the signs of the zodiac,[38] and wrote an entire book, Against the
            Astrologers (Πρὸς ἀστρολόγους, Pros astrologous), compiling
            arguments against astrology. Against the Astrologers was the fifth
            section of a larger work arguing against philosophical and
            scientific inquiry in general, Against the Professors (Πρὸς
            μαθηματικούς, Pros mathematikous). Plotinus, a neoplatonist, argued
            that since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets,
            it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on human affairs
            should depend on their position with respect to the zodiac. He also
            argues that the interpretation of the Moon's conjunction with a
            planet as good when the moon is full, but bad when the moon is
            waning, is clearly wrong, as from the Moon's point of view, half of
            its surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of
            view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light
            from the Moon, but when the Moon is full to us, it is dark, and
            therefore bad, on the side facing the planet in question.[39]

            The conquest of Asia by Alexander the Great exposed the Greeks to
            ideas from Syria, Babylon, Persia and central Asia.[44] Around 280
            BCE, Berossus, a priest of Bel from Babylon, moved to the Greek
            island of Kos, teaching astrology and Babylonian culture.[45] By the
            1st century BCE, there were two varieties of astrology, one using
            horoscopes to describe the past, present and future; the other,
            theurgic, emphasising the soul's ascent to the stars.[46] Greek
            influence played a crucial role in the transmission of astrological
            theory to Rome.[47] The first definite reference to astrology in
            Rome comes from the orator Cato, who in 160 BCE warned farm
            overseers against consulting with Chaldeans,[48] who were described
            as Babylonian 'star-gazers'.[49] Among both Greeks and Romans,
            Babylonia (also known as Chaldea) became so identified with
            astrology that 'Chaldean wisdom' became synonymous with divination
            using planets and stars.[50] The 2nd-century Roman poet and satirist
            Juvenal complains about the pervasive influence of Chaldeans,
            saying, "Still more trusted are the Chaldaeans; every word uttered
            by the astrologer they will believe has come from Hammon's
            fountain."[51] One of the first astrologers to bring Hermetic
            astrology to Rome was Thrasyllus, astrologer to the emperor
            Tiberius,[47] the first emperor to have had a court astrologer,[52]
            though his predecessor Augustus had used astrology to help
            legitimise his Imperial rights.[53]
